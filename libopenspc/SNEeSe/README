The code in this directory is either taken directly from SNEeSe, modified
from SNEeSe, or created by Brad Martin based on SNEeSe code.  As such, all
code in this directory falls under the SNEeSe license, and not the OpenSPC
license.  Specifically, these files have been copied verbatim from the
SNEeSe v0.74 source:

* misc.ni
* regs.ni
* spcaddr.ni
* spcmacro.ni
* spcops.ni

These files were originally taken from the SNEeSe source and modified for
use with OpenSPC:

* SPC700.asm
* spc.ni

These files were independently created but contain some code derived from
SNEeSe:

* SPCimpl.c
* SPCimpl.h
